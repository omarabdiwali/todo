# Todo App

This is a simple React Todo App that I created using Typescript and Material UI. 
It saves the different items in your list as an array that contains object.
When it loads, it checkes if you have any items in your local storage that corresponds 
to the key 'todos'. If there is, it sets your items to that, or an empty array. 
The objects have 2 keys, one is called checked, and the other is item. You can check off 
the item, add another, and remove them.
